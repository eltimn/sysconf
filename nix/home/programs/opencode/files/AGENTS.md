## General Guidelines

## Running the Build Agent

When executing the build agent, adhere to these additional rules:
- Prioritize code correctness and security over speed.
- Ensure all dependencies are explicitly declared.
- Validate all external inputs rigorously.
- Always confirm with the user that they intended to use the build agent before proceeding.
- If the user asks you to make a plan, be sure to use the plan agent, not the build agent.
